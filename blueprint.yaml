  Acting as the "front door" to Azure, streaming from Particle into IoT Hub will
  make it easy to forward device data onto any of Azure's products to add intelligence and
  robustness to your IoT product or application. Here are some examples of
  things you could do with Particle + Azure IoT Hub:
  - Predict when a piece of equipment needs maintenance ahead of time using
    predictive analytics
  - Detect anomalies in product behavior by analyzing device data from an
    entire fleet simultaneously
  - Trigger a notification to a device owner when supplies are running low
